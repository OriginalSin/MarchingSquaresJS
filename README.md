Marching squares outlines blobs of non-transparent pixels inside a bitmap.

This is a straight forward port from this excellent implementation by Phill Spiess:

This is a Javascript implementation designed to be used with Html5 Canvas.

Check out the code in marchingSquaresTest.html for usage example.


Here's a few codepen demos using it:
